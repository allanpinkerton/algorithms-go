# algorithms-go
Various algorithms implemented in Go

Starting with sorting algorthims, I will implement several algorithms and compare and analyze their actual running time and memory consumption.
Then, I will compare different implementations of the same algorithms (stack v.s. fibonacci stack, for example) as well as single threaded v.s. concurrent.
